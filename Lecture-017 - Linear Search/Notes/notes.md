# Linear Search

Linear Search is useful where elements are not in order (not sorted).
If elements are in order then other algorithms performs best.
This is done by traversing each element in the array.

1. Find 1st occurrence of an element.
2. Find all occurrences of an element and count number of occurrences.
3. Find last occurrence of an element.
4. Find if element is present or not.
5. Find max and min of elements in array.
6. Do all the above for 2D arrays.
