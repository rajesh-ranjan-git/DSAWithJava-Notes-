# Bitonic Array

An array elements are first in increasing order then decreasing order or vice versa. Here the element are strictly sorted with no duplicate element on each side. Overall in the array duplicates can be there but on the opposite sides.
Eg. : int arr[] = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 16, 13, 11, 9, 4, 3, 2, 1 };

Note -> It is also solved by Binary Search Algorithm.

> Find minimum element in a Bitonic Array.

1. Minimum element in a Bitonic Array will be minimum of first and last element in the array.

> Find peak element in a Bitonic Array.

Note -> Peak is also called Bitonic point, maximum element.
-> Peak element is always greater or equal to its adjacent elements.

1. Find previous and next element.
2. If the
