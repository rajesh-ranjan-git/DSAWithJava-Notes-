# What is a flowchart?

It is a diagram that represents a workflow or process.
It is nothing but a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm,
a step-by-step approach to solving a task.

# What are components of a flowchart?

It shows the steps as boxes of various kinds,
and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows.

# Some Important symbols (boxes) are:

1. Oval - It marks the Start/End of the flow.
2. Arrow - Connector which shows the flow of relationship between various symbols.
3. Parallelogram - It represents input and output.
4. Rectangle - It represents a process.
5. Diamond - It is used in decision formation.

# What is Process?

A process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed.

# What is a Algorithm?

An algorithm is a procedure or set of rules that defines how a program is to be executed.
In the algorithm, plain text is used.
The algorithm does not follow any rules.
E.g Brute Force Algorithm, Greedy Algorithm.

# What is a Pseudocode?

It is the mimic of a code.
Represents code-like structure of a algorithm.
